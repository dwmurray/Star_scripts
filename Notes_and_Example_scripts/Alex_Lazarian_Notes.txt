Makes the statment that the eddy's align to the magnetic field as you go to smaller scales. Referenced Goldreich Sidrah 1995 paper and said they missed one ting.
Look up: Velocity Channel Gradients.
Can we use density gradients? NOt good for tracing mag fields. at least not at high machs. Intensity gradients much more sensitive to shocks.
What about self gravity regions? VCGs are mostly perp to B field, as you get closer to star.
Super Alfvenic turbulence can be traced with synchrotron radiation.

Theturbulent velocity will scale differently if its parallel vs perp to mag field. || = l^2/3, perp = l^1/3.


What is a transluscent cloud?
